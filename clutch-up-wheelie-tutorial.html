            <h2>How to Do a Clutch-Up Wheelie</h2>
            <p>Clutch-up wheelies are a key move for mastering control over your motorbike and leveling up your riding skills. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you nail it.</p>
            
            <div class="tutorial-step">
                <h3>Step 1: Find a Safe, Open Space</h3>
                <p>Before you start, make sure you're practicing in a controlled environment—preferably a large, open space with little to no traffic. Safety is key!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tutorial-step">
                <h3>Step 2: Get Into First Gear</h3>
                <p>Make sure your bike is in first gear. You’ll want the bike to have enough torque to lift the front wheel off the ground without struggling. Stay steady on your throttle.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tutorial-step">
                <h3>Step 3: Pull the Clutch In</h3>
                <p>Pull the clutch lever in completely and hold it while keeping a stable hand on the throttle.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tutorial-step">
                <h3>Step 4: Rev the Throttle</h3>
                <p>Now, with the clutch still in, rev the throttle to give the engine a boost of power. You’re essentially preparing the bike to jump into action as soon as you release the clutch.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tutorial-step">
                <h3>Step 5: Pop the Clutch and Lean Back</h3>
                <p>Quickly release the clutch while maintaining your throttle. As soon as the clutch engages, the front wheel will start to lift. Lean back slightly to help the front rise, but don’t yank the bars or you’ll lose balance.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tutorial-step">
                <h3>Step 6: Balance and Throttle Control</h3>
                <p>Once the front wheel is up, it's all about balance and throttle control. Don’t go overboard—keep steady on the gas and adjust your body position as needed to maintain the wheelie.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tutorial-step">
                <h3>Step 7: Set the Front Wheel Down Gently</h3>
                <p>When you’re ready to bring the wheel back down, slowly ease off the throttle. Control the descent to prevent the front wheel from slamming down, which could cause loss of control.</p>
            </div>

                <p>Disclaimer: Hey, if you're trying this, you’re taking your own risks. Playing around with clutch-ups can be fun, but if you like keeping your body and bike intact, maybe keep both wheels on the ground. Wheelies are cool until you hit the pavement. Ride safe, and don't say we didn't warn ya!</p>
