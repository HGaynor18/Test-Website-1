                <h2>Basic Motorbike Control</h2>
                <p>Mastering the basics of motorbike control is the first step to becoming a confident rider. Let's break it down:</p>
                
                <div class="tutorial-step">
                    <h3>Step 1: Understanding the Controls</h3>
                    <p>Get familiar with the throttle, clutch, brakes, and gears. Practice using them while the bike is stationary to develop muscle memory.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="tutorial-step">
                    <h3>Step 2: Mounting and Dismounting</h3>
                    <p>Always mount and dismount from the left side of the bike. Make sure the bike is stable with the kickstand down before getting on or off.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="tutorial-step">
                    <h3>Step 3: Balancing and Weight Shifting</h3>
                    <p>Balance is key to riding. Practice sitting comfortably and shifting your weight when needed to maintain control, especially when turning.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="tutorial-step">
                    <h3>Step 4: Start Slow</h3>
                    <p>Practice riding at low speeds in a straight line before gradually increasing your speed. This helps you build confidence and improves throttle control.</p>

                    <p>Disclaimer: Keep your feet on the ground—literally and metaphorically. Practice makes perfect, but don’t push beyond your limits until you’ve mastered the basics!</p>
