            <h2>How to Master Trail Braking on a Motorbike</h2>
            <p>Trail braking is a technique used to carry brake pressure into a corner while maintaining control and stability. It’s an advanced skill that allows you to maximize your entry speed into turns, while keeping your bike balanced and improving cornering precision.</p>
            
            <div class="tutorial-step">
                <h3>Step 1: Approach the Corner</h3>
                <p>As you approach a corner, begin braking as usual. The goal of trail braking is to smoothly transition from straight-line braking into the corner while maintaining control.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tutorial-step">
                <h3>Step 2: Initiate Lean and Reduce Brake Pressure</h3>
                <p>As you start to lean into the corner, gradually reduce your front brake pressure. Don’t release the brake all at once—keep a light touch on it as you enter the turn.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="tutorial-step">
                <h3>Step 3: Control Brake Pressure</h3>
                <p>Maintain light braking as you continue to lean into the turn. This allows you to keep weight on the front tire, increasing traction and making the bike more responsive through the corner.</p>

            <div class="tutorial-step">
                <h3>Step 4: Release the Brake Smoothly</h3>
                <p>Once you’ve reached the apex of the turn, gradually release the front brake and transition fully to throttle control as you exit the corner. This ensures a smooth and controlled transition out of the turn.</p>

            <footer>
                <p>Disclaimer: Trail braking is an advanced technique. Practice in safe, controlled environments before trying it at higher speeds. Don’t overdo it—you still need rubber on the road to ride another day!</p>
